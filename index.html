        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate student in the Paul G. Allen School for Computer Science & Engineering and the Information School at the University of Washington, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Informatics. I work as a teaching assistant for INFO 330: Databases and Data Modeling, supporting students in SQL and relational database design. I am also a research assistant in the Golden Lab, working on projects applying machine learning and analysis to data from implantable devices.
        <p>My academic interests include software engineering, data science, and product development, with a focus on building tools that bridge technical depth with practical impact.</p>
